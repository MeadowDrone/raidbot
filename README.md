# Raidbot - <a href="https://telegram.me/originalstatic_bot">@originalstatic_bot</a>

> This is a silly bot that uses the Telegram bot API, built around leandrotoledo's Telegram bot wrapper and other gracefully borrowed modules from other Telegram bots. Its main purpose is to help keep our FFXIV static raid group "Original Static, Do Not Steal" organised.

**Version**: 0.0.2
